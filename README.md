# DDoS-Attacks-in-SDN-using-Machine-Learning
This project implements a system to detect Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks in Software-Defined Networks (SDN) using a Decision Tree algorithm. By analyzing network traffic, the system can accurately classify and differentiate between normal and malicious traffic, enhancing network security and reliability.

Features
- Data Collection: Gathers network traffic data for analysis.
- Preprocessing: Cleans and extracts relevant features from the data.
- Model Training: Uses a Decision Tree algorithm to train on the data.
 -Detection: Classifies incoming traffic in real-time to identify potential DDoS attacks.
- Evaluation: Assesses the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall.
